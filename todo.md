Realistically
* Wider and more accurate data-filling for pose structs
  * Investigate usage of pose file data for filling in some information
* After all poses are worked through, there should be a review stage

Wants
* Research the anamnesis and cmt file formats and offer file converting
* Research the difference in the data between races and offer race conversion
* A front-end not based on ajax vomit and a style concept of "round and gray"
