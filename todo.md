Realistically

* Copy fields from last pose
* Add key to file names, so working files that exist under the key can be
  removed before new files are saved
* Cast inputs to `new pose()`
* Function to swap folder structures mid work_through
* After all poses are worked through, there should be a review stage

Wants

* Wider and more accurate data-filling for pose structs
  * Investigate usage of pose file data for filling in some information
* Research the anamnesis and cmt file formats and offer file converting
* Research the difference in the data between races and offer race conversion
* A front-end not based on ajax vomit
