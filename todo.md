Realistically
* Gender detection provide recognizable null value
* Race+Gender detection should not require a space
* Copy fields from last pose
* Search XIVMA for author
* Reset image button - eg reset back to detected picture after selecting a pose
  pack
* Cast inputs to `new pose()`
* Function to swap folder structures mid work_through
* After all poses are worked through, there should be a review stage

Wants
* Wider and more accurate data-filling for pose structs
  * Investigate usage of pose file data for filling in some information
* Research the anamnesis and cmt file formats and offer file converting
* Research the difference in the data between races and offer race conversion
* A front-end not based on ajax vomit
