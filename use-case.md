## crash course

folders are named with general information of whether it’s nsfw or not, the general category of the mood of it, and if it’s a group pose (and how many people it expects)

files (click the flatten hierarchy button) have more specific information. file names start with an abbreviation of the folder attributes and then the clothes you should be wearing, the generic position of the pose (sit/kneel, etc), if the pose requires another person (and if they do, whether this pose is sub or dom to that person), and a verb of what the pose is doing. A list of verbs used is available at the bottom.

all pose packs were spread out into individual poses

pose names and author names are preserved or added to both the folder and file names

  
**Example Searches**

_folder names_ - better for just trying several poses

* sfw adventure group(2)
* lewd dance group(2)
* nsfw cute alone

_file names_ - better for finding a specific setup

* {sca} clothed crying
* {nfg(3)} naked lay sub  

  
Thankfully, anamnesis uses some fuzzy searching so you can mishmash search terms from different parts of the names of files or folders. For example, you don’t have to specify the position when searching for the clothing status and dom/sub of a pose, even though that’s in the middle of those two attributes in the file name.

  
### when doing solo posing,

it will likely be best to flatten the hierarchy, search for the folder attributes you want with “a}” at the end, clothes you are wearing, and a verb  
such as: {sca} clothed crying  
(which will give a SFW, cute, and solo pose with clothes on, and crying)

### when doing group posing,

it will likely be best to to start a series of shots in folder view, looking for the attributes you want, such as sfw and group(2). As you get more into the posing, probably switch to flatten hierarchy and search pose names with “g(2)}” at the end.  
such as: {nfg(3)} naked lay sub  
(which will yield a NSFW, erotic, group (of 3) pose with no clothes, laying down, in a submissive position)

/ <preview picture\> (?)

/ <link to page\> (?)

/ <part of pack= <name\> \>.txt (?)

  
## folders

(n)nsfw        (f)erotic       (g(x))group(x)

## file names

clothed      sit        sub(wants-other)     <verb\>

smalls       stand     dom(wants-other)

naked        kneel     alone

lay

... <wants-other(X)\> <race\> <gender\> ‘<pose name\>’ \[<author\>\]

  
<wants-other\> is somewhat separate from folder attribute’s “group(X)” in that it’s just if it requires someone else. For example: in a sub getting-fucked situation, you may not need anyone, but for a dom fucking-someone situation, you would need someone.

<race\>, <gender\> are not added, only included if it was present in the pose name

<pose name\> and <author\> are added if possible

  
### used <verbs\>

* crying
